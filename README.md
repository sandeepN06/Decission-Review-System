# Decision-Review-System

This is a DECISSION REVIEW SYSTEM gui where you can import your local vedio and check with the buttons below (Fast forward or slow) . Control and Decission is in your hands ;)

I have prepared this project in a seperate environment. Viewers who are interested can just change vedios on the project and include others too , and must install different packages (Check imports in main.py)
